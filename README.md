A/B test and logistic regression exercice

This project is organized in an exercice way, where question are asked on the online course, and we are answering them by exploring and analyzing a data set.

In this exercice, The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

After checking the data set properties and perfoming a little bit of cleaning, we tackle the problem in two ways : A/B test and regression approach.

First, we then start an A/B testing by defining a null and alternative hypothesis. After performing calculation of the p-value and comparing it with the error rate, we conclude about wether or not there is evidence that the new page leads to higher number of users who convert.
Second, we try to find the same result by performaing a regression. We use a logistic regression as it is best suited for predicting a categorical response (conversion or not). At the end we discuss how adding factor to the model could have an impact of the decision making.
